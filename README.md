# Jayanth R Varma's `.emacs` (init files)

Like many others, I too share my `init` files in the hope that others would find bits and pieces of these files useful. Emacs is highly customizable and no two people are likely to use the same `init` files. Dropping somebody's `init` files into your `.emacs` is often a prescription for disaster. You have to pick and choose what is relevant to you.

My `init.el` consisting of around 700 lines of code relies on `use-package` which makes it easy to pick and choose what is needed. Most of my `lisp` functions (over 1,000 lines of code) is in separate packages in the `my-lisp` folder. The current structure of the code is the result of a complete refactoring of the code in April 2019.

A couple of `bash`/`python` scripts called from within my `init` files have been uploaded in the `bin` folder.
